## Todo:
- Fix the application before building new features

- Features:
  - Dashboard view
    - Display all the books inside the Dashboard
    - When you click on a book, you should navigate to the detail of that book
    - 
    - Implement the search for the books using Observable (Not trivial)
      - Delay the call to the API by 300 milliseconds
      - Once the result is diplayed, clicking on it should navigate to the detail of that book

  - Manage books view
   - Once again, show all the books
   - CRUD API
     - Add a new book with a title only
     - Delete a book by id
     - Get a book by id

  - Book Detail view
    - Implement the save button: It should update the book's title
    - Implement the goBack button
   
  - Introducing Redux
    - After a quick introduction to Redux, let's reimplement our application using it

- Angular-CLI
  - Productivity tools


  - interface isMatching(action: Action):true|false && run(state): State
